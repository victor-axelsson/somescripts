# somescripts
This is all the scripts that i frequently use on my NIX systems. 

#Want to contribute?
Sure, just make sure: 
- Every script must have a header section with a script description
- Remove all sensitive data such as ip-addresses, username and passwords. 

#Other that that
You may use the scripts for whatever purpose you see fit. The possible damage you do to your system by running the scripts is 
your own responsibillity. I take no responisbillity what so ever.
